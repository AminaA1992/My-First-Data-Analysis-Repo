# Data Sourcing 
The data was sourced from github

# Data Transformation
The data underwent several transformations;
1. Three datas named confirmed, death and recovered cases were loaded into excel
2. Power query was used to merge all three datas to have a consolidated data
3. I changed the datas from wide format to long format by unpivoting the date colums
4. I changed the date column's data type to date.
5. After loading into excel, three new columns named year, month and day were created to get yearly, monthly and daily records of covid 19 cases.
6. Pivot table and charts were used to extract all data.
